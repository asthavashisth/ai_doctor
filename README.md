🏥 AI Health Assistant – Symptom-Based Disease Prediction & Personalized Health Advice
🔍 Description:

This project is an intelligent AI-based medical assistant that takes user-input symptoms (via text or voice), predicts the most probable disease using trained machine learning models, and delivers complete personalized care guidance — including:

Detailed disease description

Suggested precautions

Recommended medications

Healthy diet plans

Custom workout routines

The system uses multiple ML algorithms for evaluation and selection, providing highly accurate predictions based on a wide range of symptoms.

💡 Key Features
Predicts diseases from symptom input using multiple ML models

Supports voice recognition for symptom input

Provides explanations and lifestyle suggestions

Handles invalid or misspelled symptoms gracefully

Clean and modern Bootstrap UI with modal-based results
